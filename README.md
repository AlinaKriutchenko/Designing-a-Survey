MIS770 - Foundation Skills In Data Analysis 

This unit aims to develop foundation skills and knowledge required for data driven, evidence based approaches to business decision making and business performance analysis. To this end, the unit first introduces the skills necessary to enable an understanding of business metrics. 

This is followed by descriptive analytical techniques that transform both structured and unstructured data into meaningful information for the purpose of decision making and understanding and reviewing business performance. 

Techniques and principles of data visualisation are introduced that enable graphical depictions of data that can improve comprehension, communication and decision-making. Then, the unit introduces quantitative reasoning skills so students are able to review business performance to find problems or areas of opportunities, and identify patterns and trends in data using descriptive and inferential statistics.
